Steganography is the practice of hiding information in another message or object so that it's not easily detected. The word "steganography" comes from the
Greek words steganos (hidden or covered) and graphein (to write). 

How does steganography work?

 * Least significant bit (LSB) steganography: The most common technique, which hides data in the least significant bits of an image 
 * Network steganography: Hides data in network communication protocols, such as TCP/IP 
 * Word and letter substitution: A method of hiding text by replacing letters or words 
 * Video steganography: Embeds data in a video file 

 Different types of steganography:
  1 Text steganography
  2 Image steganography
  3 Audio steganography
  4 vedio Steganography
  5 Network or protocol Steganography
  
Steganography Tools:
  1 openstego
  2 steghide
  3 outguess
  4 hide n shoot
  
 Examples of steganography: 
 .Hiding a message in the title or context of an image or video
 .Misspelling words to suggest a different meaning
 .Embedding text in a picture
 .Backward masking a message in an audio file
 
Uses of steganography:
steganography can be used to hide secret messages or code .however,it can also be used by malware devlopers to hide malicious code

Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other files, such as images, audio, or text, to conceal its existence. 
Below is a step-by-step guide to performing image-based steganography, where we hide a secret message inside an image.

Step 1: Choose a Steganography Tool

There are several tools available for steganography, such as:
OpenStego (open-source, supports watermarking and data hiding)
Steghide (command-line tool for embedding messages in images or audio)
SilentEye (GUI-based tool for Windows and Linux)
Hide and Seek (Android app)

Step 2: Install and Open the Tool

1. Download and install your preferred steganography tool.
2. Open the tool and prepare your carrier file (an image that will hide the message).
3. Have your secret message ready (text, file, or another image).

Step 3: Hide the Message in an Image

Using OpenStego (GUI-based)
1. Open OpenStego.
2. Select the "Embed Data" option.
3. Choose the cover file (image to hide data in).
4. Select the secret file (text or another file to hide).
5. Set a password (optional but recommended for encryption).
6. Click "Embed" to create the stego image (the new image with hidden data).

Using Steghide (Command Line)
1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Use the command:
     steghide embed -cf cover.jpg -ef secret.txt -sf output.jpg
          cover.jpg → Image used as a cover.
          secret.txt → File you want to hide.
          output.jpg → New stego image with hidden data.
3. Enter a passphrase when prompted.

Step 4: Extract the Hidden Message

Using OpenStego

1. Open OpenStego.
2. Select "Extract Data".
3. Choose the stego image.
4. Enter the password (if used).
5. Extract the hidden file.
     Using Steghide (Command Line)
      1. Use the command:
          steghide extract -sf output.jpg
      2. Enter the passphrase when prompted.
      3. The hidden file will be extracted.

Step 5: Verify the Integrity
 Check if the extracted message is intact.
Ensure the stego image looks natural
